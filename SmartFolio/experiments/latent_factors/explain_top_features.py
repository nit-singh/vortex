'Top features' = input features with highest absolute decoder weights per latent

Selection process:
  1. For each latent (column of decoder matrix)
  2. Sort all input features by |weight|
  3. Take top-k (default: 10)
  4. These are the features that latent 'cares about most'

In show_top_features.py:
  - We filter by min_weight threshold (default: 0.05)
  - Pick one feature per ticker (weighted random)
  - Display in randomized order
  
Result: Only 67/97 tickers appear because the other 30 have weak weights everywhere.
